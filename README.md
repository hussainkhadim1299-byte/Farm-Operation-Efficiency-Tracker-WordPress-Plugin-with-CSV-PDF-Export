# 🌱 Farm Operation Efficiency Tracker (WordPress Plugin)

An all-in-one **farm tracking dashboard** built as a single PHP file with inline HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It helps farmers measure operational efficiency, track crop yields, expenses, and labor hours, and export data into **CSV** or **PDF reports** directly from the browser.
